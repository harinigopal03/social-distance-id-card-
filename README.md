# social-distance-id-card-
The importance of social distance concept was raised 
during the COVID period. But as COVID is not fully 
eradicated social distancing will still be prevalent in 
coming time.
• The problem with social distancing is people tend to forget 
about it every now and then. Remind every person each 
time is not feasible.
• So here we develop a wearable social distancing ID card 
that will remind people to maintain social distancing 
whenever they are too close to someone else. This system 
will provide an automated way to ensure social distancing.
• While moving in crowded areas you don't want to worry 
about covid. Always wear this social distance reminder ID. 
It will be making you completely ready. Components Used
